Agon Light 2 - system bring-up and later development.

Possibly quite primitive.  Focus is on updating the
newly-arrived product to current revisions of MOS
and VDP.  Possibly others as well (BASIC?)

agon-forth working well.  bbcbasic just getting started;
found a way to make a program delay (to slow the triangles
demo a bit, was that goal).

#### agon-forth

  working on dump.fs - this repository does not yet have the
  current development effort on that one.  Still crafting a
  suitable workflow.

#### agon hardware

  PS/2 (f) to USB microB (f) adaptor crafted from a Fried Circuits
  USB breakout type of board, a PS/2 connector, and just a USB
  microB to USB-A male standard cable.  Straight DC wiring.  Works
  just fine with Agon Light 2.

  Keyboards are an old Compaq PS/2 keyboard (full layout) and also an
  iOpener keyboard.  Both tested and are at least somewhat functional.
  Have not noticed issues (yet) with the Compaq.  The iOpener keyboard
  is not really as useful; will probably try to use it for extended
  periods (to be sure there's a backup keyboard on-hand).

end.
